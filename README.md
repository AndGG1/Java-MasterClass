# Java-MasterClass

- *Here I'll post all the challanges from the Java Masterclass course on udemy, starting from section 15*

- *There will be a foder for every challange/exercise*

**NOTE: THESE ARE MY SOLUTIONS THAT MAY DIFFER LESS OR MORE THAN TIM'S SOLUTION(the instructor)**


Feel free to play around with these exercises and make them better if you want, this is a beginner friendly project where anyone is invited to contribute and learn. I consider these projects easy and good for new learners of Java.

I am not making an AD but if you want to learn Java, I suggest to look up on Udemy at "Java Masterclass" which has Tim as an instructor, he is in this domain for over 40 years and he works with Java for over 25 years.
